This hand in includes a mostly functional gui interface, including the map, buttons for selecting
start and end nodes, the ability to load different maps, and the ability to select nodes with the
mouse. UML diagrams are included in PRJ3_uml_files.

To select a node, click somewhere on the map and then click on one of the Select node buttons.
Currently set so you can only select nodes on roads. Selecting anywhere will select the nearest 
road node.

Implemented the Haversine Formula for finding distances over the map. This is used for finding
shortest distances from one point to a node by iterating over all the nodes. (Rather inefficient)
This will also be used for finding the lengths of GraphEdges.

There is a skeletal implementation of many of the features for finding a route, including a number
of Graph interfaces. The Director class will make use of the features in these interfaces to
generate a list of directions from one point to another.

Director is now the GPSInterface for convenience. This may be split off later depending on how
large the class becomes.

GraphEdges and RoadEdges are currently are currently not in use, and should be considered essentially
skeleton classes despite having all their methods implemented.
