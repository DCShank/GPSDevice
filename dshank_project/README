Readme for project 4.

Controls: Left click to select a start node, right click to select an end node.
		  Buttons for other controls. Load a new map from the file menu.
		  
Project 4 design documentation can be found in the PRJ4_Design_Documentation folder.

Features that I can remember implementing:
	Pan
	Zoom to mouse
	Select start node
	Select end node
	Get driving directions
	Drive there mode
	Track driver position
	Off course detection
	Directed map, as opposed to all two way.
	Loading alternative maps from the application
	Colorful display :)
	Concurrent graphics (Loading maps, finding directions, and off course detection occur in swing workers.)
	User friendly: Buttons are only accessible when they have a function
	Message display at the bottom of the application
	
	Notable things about shortest path calculation:
		Shortest paths are calculated on "segments" using a priority queue.
		
		A segment is, essentially, a composite edge going from one intersection or dead end to another.
		
		The priority queue was implemented by simply readding something to the queue whenever it's distance
		decreased. This is still much more efficient than list searching, and a research paper produced
		here at Stony Brook indicates it was about as efficient for them.
		
		As far as I can tell path search is about comparable to GPSDevice.
		
	
	Other notes:
		Larger maps still take a long time to load, and hovered node doesn't work very quickly on them.
