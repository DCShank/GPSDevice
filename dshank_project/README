This hand in includes a mostly functional gui interface.
Currently set so you can only select nodes on roads with the mouse. Selecting anywhere will select
the nearest road node.

Changes from the initial design:
There are now GraphNodes and GraphEdges. Director now depends on these instead of the map itself.



TODO: Figure out how "segments" should work, where a segment goes from one "intersection" to
to another, and an intersection is where two ways intersect. I believe this would make shortest
path calculation faster than going through all the graph edges.
