This hand in includes a mostly functional gui interface.
Currently set so you can only select nodes on roads with the mouse. Selecting anywhere will select
the nearest road node.

to another, and an intersection is where two ways intersect. I believe this would make shortest
path calculation faster than going through all the graph edges.
